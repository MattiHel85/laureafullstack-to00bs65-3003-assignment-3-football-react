# Teamfinder 1.0

React front end to connected to back end I made as part of my studies at Laurea UAS.

## 23.10.2023 - update 

Teamfinder 2.0 is under construction and will be deployed when it is ready

### Description of app

Teamfinder is a react app that displays details of football teams from my own rest API [rest_api_assignment_TO00BS65-3003 - repo ](https://github.com/MattiHel85/rest_api_assignment_TO00BS65-3003).

The API uses CRUD functionality to create, read, update, and delete teams from the database hosted in Mongo Atlas with the actual back end hosted in Render [rest_api_assignment_TO00BS65-3003 - Render](https://football-teams-rest-api-assignment.onrender.com/api/).

I have also implemented a basic search function so you don't need to scroll to find the team you want to find information on.
