# Teamfinder

React front end to connected to back end I made as part of my studies at Laurea UAS.

## 12.4.2023 - update 

I will gradually switch over from useEffect to react query for API calls and will be making improvements to the UI and general responsiveness. Once user functionality is added to the backend (i.e. require signup to add/teams and admin status to approve changes/delete teams) the front end will be updated too.

### Description of app

Teamfinder is a react app that displays details of football teams from my own API [rest_api_assignment_TO00BS65-3003](https://github.com/MattiHel85/rest_api_assignment_TO00BS65-3003).

It uses CRUD functionality to create, read, update, and delete teams from the database hosted in Mongo Atlas here [rest_api_assignment_TO00BS65-3003](https://football-teams-rest-api-assignment.onrender.com/api/).

I have also implemented a basic search function so you don't need to scroll to find the team you want to find information on.
