# Teamfinder

React front end to connected to back end I made as part of my studies at Laurea UAS.

## Description of app

Teamfinder is a react app that displays details of football teams from my own API [rest_api_assignment_TO00BS65-3003](https://github.com/MattiHel85/rest_api_assignment_TO00BS65-3003).

It uses CRUD functionality to create, read, update, and delete teams from the database hosted in Mongo Atlas here [rest_api_assignment_TO00BS65-3003](https://football-teams-rest-api-assignment.onrender.com/api/).

I have also implemented a basic search function so you don't need to scroll to find the team you want to find information on.
